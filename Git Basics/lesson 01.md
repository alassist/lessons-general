# Lesson 1: Getting started with Git and GitHub

Git is a tool for performing version control. Version control refers
to having different versions of one file, or many files, and being
able to retrieve an older version of such files if necessary. The main
attraction of Git, though, is its ability to allow many people to work
on one project together, with a history of what was done, so that the
project can be rolled back if necessary. Git not only stores what was
done on a project, but who does it. So, if you find a version, or
commit, to the project that you don't know about, you know who to ask
questions to.

In this course, we'll mainly be using Git through a service called
GitHub. GitHub is a service which offers Git functionality on a large
scale. With GitHub, you can work together with a team, friends, or
coworkers on a project made of folders and files called a repository,
all working on the same files thanks to version control and GitHub's
online nature. You can also work on a separate path to work on a part
of the project others don't need to see yet, and then merge your
changes into the main project when you're ready. That separate path is
called a "branch" in Git and GitHub.

## Getting Started on GitHub-

First, you'll need to make an account. Go to <GitHub.com> and choose the "sign
up" link. It'll be after the "site search" field. Once you've clicked, or
pressed Enter on, the "sign up" link, you'll be taken to a page for entering
your information to create an account. Enter the requested information. For
staff, use your AIDB email address, and your username should be your last name,
a dash (-), then your first name, like "prater-devin". Complete the visual or
audio captcha to prove that you're a human, and proceed to create your account.

After you've created your account, verify your email address. After that's done,
you'll find yourself on a page with a list of navigational items, your
repositories that you own or commit to, a dashboard, upcoming events, and
notable repositories.

Starting from the top, there is a "skip to content" link for screen reader
users, a link to the home page for if you get lost, and a "site search" field.

The "site search" field is where you can type in something you're looking for,
and find repositories about that subject. Most repositories on GitHub are
computer code, but there are plenty of repositories of documentation, learning
resources, and even blogs, hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

Next is "Pull requests you created". Pull requests are ways that you can work on
a project that is not yours. If you want to help a project out, you can "fork"
it. This makes a copy of that repository on your account, which you can do
anything to. When you've improved it to your satisfaction, you can make a Pull
Request to request that your changes be merged back into the original
repository.

Then you'll find "Issues you created". "Issues" are problems or suggestions about
a repository. You can make an issue on a repository to tell the creators of that
repository about a problem you've found, like code that doesn't work right, or
grammar issues in a learning resource. So, "Issues you created" shows all of the
issues you've created. This can be good if you want to check to see if there
have been any responses to your issue.

"Marketplace" is where you can find extensions to GitHub, like code review tools
and project management utilities.

"Explore" is where you can explore GitHub based on what you follow currently.
You'll also be shown trending repositories and developers.

Next, you'll find your unread notifications. This shows if you have updates in
repositories you commit to or follow, or account notifications.

Then, you'll find the "Create newâ€¦" button. If you activate it, a
drop-down box will open with the following options:

- New Repository
- Import Repository
- New gist
- New organization
- New project

## New Repository

This will allow you to create a new repository to work on. You can name it,
configure settings like if it's hidden or public, and even make it a GitHub
Pages site, for blogs or other purposes.

## Import Repository

if you already have a Git repository that you've made with another versioning
system, like Gitlab, you can import it here.

## New gist

Gists are single files that can be quickly shared with people through a link.
The file can then be worked on by multiple people, because it is a repository.
Also like a repository, it can be public or private. However, even if it is
private, you can still send a link to someone else. You can create a new Gist at
<gists.GitHub.com>. You can search for them at <gists.GitHub.com/search>.

## New organization

This allows you to create a new organization. This organization will
be made of users who have access to the same repositories.

## New Project

With project boards, you can coordinate, track, and update your work in one
place, so projects stay transparent and on schedule.
