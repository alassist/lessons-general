# Lesson 2: your first Repository

Now that you know about the Github homepage, let's make your first repository!
To do so, go to the Github website, sign in, and choose the "create" button.
From the menu, choose "new repository."

Now, fill out the information requested about the repository.

## Repository name

This is the name people, and you, can find your repository by. People can find
your repository on your profile, but they can also navigate to it directly using
an address like <https://www.github.com/prater-devin/lessons-general>. So, if
you name your repository "homework", and your username is gentry-student, your
repository would be at <https://www.github.com/gentry-student/homework>.

## Description (optional)

This is where you can describe what your repository is for. If it's for storing
your homework, you can describe it as such.
